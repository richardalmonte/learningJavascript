<p>When working on a new feature/issue/bug, please, create a branch and a pull request (to merge) to the master branch.</p>
<p>The <code>master</code> branch is protected by <code>branch policies</code> so, changes will be added only through Pull Requests.</p>
<p>The <code>develop</code> branch is the next release version.<br>
So the flow should be, from <code>develop</code> to <code>master</code>.</p>
